Get started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `fuzzyfinder` for local development.

1. Fork the `fuzzyfinder` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/fuzzyfinder.git

3. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests and
   type checks, and respect the project's code style. This project uses ``tox``
   for running tests on multiple versions of Python (with ``pytest`` and
   ``coverage``), for type checking (with ``mypy``), and for formatting (with
   ``ruff``)::

    $ tox -e py38,py39,py310,py311,py312,py313  # add any other supported versions
    $ tox -e typing
    $ tox -e style

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
