**fuzzyfinder** is a fuzzy finder implemented in Python. It matches partial
string entries from a list of strings, and works similar to the fuzzy finder in
SublimeText and Vim's Ctrl-P plugin.

Some notable features of fuzzyfinder are:

* **Simple**, easy to understand code.
* **No external dependencies**, just the python standard library.
